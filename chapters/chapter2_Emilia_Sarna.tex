\subsection{Equasions}
For polynomial of degree $n$: $P(x) = a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\>...\>+a_{1}x+a_{0}$
 Vieta's formulas are: 
\[x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots\>+x_{n-1}+x_{n}=-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}\] 
\[x_{1}x_{2}\cdots\>x_{n-1}x_{n}=-1^{n}\frac{a_{0}}{a_{n}}\]
\[x_{1}x_{2}+x_{1}x_{3}+\cdots\>+x_{n-1}x_{n}=\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}}\]
where $x_{1},x_{2},\cdots\>,x_{n},$ are the roots of this polynomial.

\subsection{Few paragraphs}
\vspace{0.5cm}\noindent \textbf{\emph{\underline{Mathematics}} is one of the most fascinating fields that you can study.} But beware because it has already led many to madness during countless hours of solving the unsolvable. Many died as well in the pursuit of uncovering mathematics' biggest mysteries \textit{(see~Table~\ref{tab:esarna})}.

However, great devotion comes with a great reward. There is a myriad of prizes and various awards. But there is one that overshadows them all - \underline{mathematical immortality}, fame and glory till the end of our civilization. There is a chance to stand among the great ones: \textbf{\textit{Pythagoras}}, \textbf{\textit{Euclid}} or John Venn \textit{(see~Figure~\ref{fig:Venn})}.
